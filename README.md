This project explore the audio spectrum of a CFM engine's noise (compression waves)
Data was collected with a logitech usb microphone on September 19, 2020
Data files include:

1. Plane_Stopped.csv - representing the noise floor of ambient audio signals
2. Plane_Stopped_AirCond.csv - representing the noise generated by the noise floor and the in cabin air conditioning unit
3. Plane_sounds.csv - representing the noise data collected from 2 CFM engines powering down upon landing, ferrying, then stopping on the tarmac

All data collected in each of these files are power signals incedent on the microphone used to record the noise.
Each data point represents a time series measurement in dBm (decibels per milliwatt)
Data was generated from .wav files
	- sampling frequency: 44.1 kHz
	- Quantization: 16 bits
